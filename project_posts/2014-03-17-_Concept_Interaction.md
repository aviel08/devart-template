The imagined interaction scenario consists of 3 steps:

1.The user approaches the monolith
2.A second user is prompted to interact
3.Face swapping begins

It is important to emphasise that the face swapping effect must be gradual. Making a subtle transition will help both users to embrace their new face as their own, since it will pass unnoticed for a while, and reinforce the artistic concept.
