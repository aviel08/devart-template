The following is a test of the transition that will be used both in the installation and web version. It was exciting to finally be able to see my concept up and running. I'm greatly satisfied with the quality of the masking. The blending is flawless and there's a noticeable improvement between this video and the images from the previous post. The video is slightly lengthy but I have been clear in previous posts of the importance of a smooth transition in the project.
