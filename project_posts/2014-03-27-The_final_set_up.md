The initial stage is now complete. The final project will consist of two main elements: the installation and the website. The installation will be held at the Barbican and the website will go up only after the opening. Since these are two different experiences, the medium and the technologies also differ. For the installation a standalone build on Openframeworks will be running inside the monolith. The website on the other hand uses JavaScript and it will be a Google Chrome experiment site.
The remaining steps are to build the monolith and to add an interface to the website.

The interaction on the website will be held between two online users that will be randomly connected. Their faces will be substituted using their webcams. If no second second user is found online, a pre recorded video from a locally hosted library will be used instead.
