## You are another I
“In lak'ech” is a Mayan greeting which means “I am another you” and which you response would be:  “Hala ken” or “you are another I” This kind of expression  is found in many religions, similar to “Namaste” but perhaps most familiarly in Western religious traditions as "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." But In lak'ech goes beyond the separation between "I and thou" to suggest that the boundary is non-existent; that separateness is an illusion of this physical world, of our bodies; that our experience of life is just an expression of a vast, collective experience of Life.
The project’s goal is to strew empathy on the people by allowing them to see the world from someone else body. In order to achieve this objective two users at the time will be placed opposed to one other, then gradually and almost imperceptibly their faces will swap.

## Inspiration
The mysterious monolith that appears on 2001: A Space Odyssey is a clear reference on the project.  The object stands still, silently and lets people to approach to it generated by their curiosity. The black cubic totem can be placed on different environments and cultural groups like it did on the movie and still would have a valid reaction from the users.
