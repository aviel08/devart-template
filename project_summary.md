## You are another I
“In lak'ech” is a Mayan greeting which means “I am another you” and which you response would be:  “Hala ken” or “you are another I” This kind of expression  is found in many religions, similar to “Namaste” but perhaps most familiarly in Western religious traditions as "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." But In lak'ech goes beyond the separation between "I and thou" to suggest that the boundary is non-existent; that separateness is an illusion of this physical world, of our bodies; that our experience of life is just an expression of a vast, collective experience of Life.
The project’s goal is to strew empathy on the people by allowing them to see the world from someone else body. In order to achieve this objective two users at the time will be placed opposed to one other, then gradually and almost imperceptibly their faces will swap.
